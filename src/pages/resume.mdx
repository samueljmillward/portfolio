## 10+ Years Experience in Hospitality

Sept 2008 - June 2021

Whilst there is little overlap between Hospitality and Software, I have gained certain skills from a variety of roles which can be invaluable in any team-based work environment.

-   Insight into efficient teamwork producing a superior product.

-   Multi-tasking and time management abilities in an environment where both are key to a successful service.

-   Interpersonal skills which have allowed me to empathise, negotiate and offer constructive criticism with my co-workers where appropriate.
