-   Frontend technology covered included;
    ECMAScript 6, React with a Test Driven Development focus using Jest, GET requests w/ Axios and Enzyme

    API development, REST API’s with CRUD. NoSQL databases, specifically using MongoDB.

-   Also included topics such as;

Since graduating from MCRcodes I have been continuously expanding my skillset.

Most recently I have been focusing on frontend topics such as; React Native, responsive design, performance and browser support as well as Static Site Generators such as Gatsby.

-   Insight into efficient teamwork producing a superior product.
