Using **[Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/)** the website's **[React](https://reactjs.org/)** code is rendered to static HTML at built time. Once a user visits the page, a JavaScript bundle is loaded asynchronously.

#### Data

Content is stored in MDX files and queried using [**GraphQL**](https://graphql.org/).

#### Styling

Styled with [**Styled Components**](https://www.styled-components.com).

#### Linting and Formatting

The code is formatted using **[Prettier](https://github.com/prettier/prettier)** and linted using **[ESLint](https://eslint.org/)**.

#### Continuous Deployment

As changes are merged into the `master` branch, the page will automatically build using **[Netlify](https://netlify.com)**. It is then deployed using the Netlify CDN.
